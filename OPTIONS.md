Test Results: All 741 tests passing with zero regressions

Roadmap Status

✅ Phase 1: Essential Types - COMPLETE
- vec_vec_int (2D arrays), vec_cstr (string arrays)

✅ Phase 2: Common Types - COMPLETE
- vec_float/vec_double (numeric), map_str_str/set_str (string containers)

⏭️ Phase 3: Parameterized System - NEXT
- Generic template generation for arbitrary types
- Complexity: HIGH (4-8 weeks)

Recommended Next Steps

Based on the roadmap and current state, the two most valuable next actions are:

Option A: Validation (Immediate, 1-2 days)
- Run performance benchmarks for C backend with new containers
- Verify vec_vec_int works in matmul benchmark
- Verify vec_cstr works in string processing
- Document performance characteristics

Option B: Architecture (Long-term, 4-8 weeks)
- Begin Phase 3: Parameterized template generation system
- Type parameter extraction (vec_<T>, map_<K>_<V>)
- Generic code generation with type substitution
- Would enable full STC independence

My Recommendation: Start with Option A (Benchmarking) to:
1. Validate the 10 container implementations work in real-world scenarios
2. Identify any performance issues or bugs
3. Provide data-driven insights for Phase 3 design decisions

Would you like me to:
1. Run benchmarks to validate the new container implementations?
2. Begin Phase 3 (parameterized template system design)?
3. Focus on a different priority from the todo list?
