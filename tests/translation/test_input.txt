Hello world! This is a simple test file.

It contains multiple sentences. Some sentences are short. Others are longer and contain more complex vocabulary and grammatical structures.

The purpose of this file is to demonstrate the text analysis capabilities of both the Python and C versions of our program.

We can analyze word frequency, calculate reading time, and determine text complexity. The program should handle various types of content effectively.

Programming languages like Python and C each have their own strengths. Python excels at rapid development and readability. C provides performance and low-level control.

This test demonstrates the successful translation between these two paradigms using the CGen framework.
