# Integration Status cgen -> mgen

Already Integrated ✅

Based on CLAUDE.md v0.1.31, CGen Feature Parity is Complete:

1. ✅ File I/O Operations - All integrated
  - File operations: open(), close(), read(), readline(), readlines(), write(), writelines()
  - Path operations: exists(), isfile(), isdir(), getsize(), basename(), dirname(), join()
  - Context manager support
2. ✅ Advanced Container Operations - All integrated
  - enumerate() for vectors, items() for hashmaps
  - Container equality, representation, conversion utilities
  - Container registry for automatic cleanup
3. ✅ Module Import System - All integrated
  - Module resolution and dependency analysis
  - import/from...import support
  - Standard library mapping (math, typing, dataclasses)
  - Cross-module function resolution with topological sort
4. ✅ Enhanced String Operations - All integrated
  - Dynamic string arrays with add/get/size operations
  - join() for combining string arrays
  - Integration with file I/O
5. ✅ NestedContainerManager - Just integrated in current session
  - Partial integration for 2D lists (vec_vec_int)

Not Yet Integrated from CGen ⚠️

Based on examining the CGen repository, here are features that CGen has but MGen doesn't yet
have fully implemented:

1. Complete Nested Container Support (Partially Done)

Status: Started in current session, needs completion

What's Missing:
- Function parameter type inference for nested containers (current bug)
- Support for deeper nesting (3D+)
- Dict and Set nested containers (only list[list] done)
- Nested dict/set types like dict[str, list[int]], list[dict[str, int]]

Estimated Work: 4-6 hours

2. Advanced Type System Features

CGen Has:
- More sophisticated type constraint checking
- Better type propagation through complex expressions
- Struct/class type inference improvements

Estimated Work: 6-8 hours

3. Memory Safety Features

CGen Has:
- More comprehensive bounds checking
- Better null pointer safety
- Enhanced memory leak detection

Estimated Work: 4-6 hours

4. Error Handling & Diagnostics

CGen Has:
- Better error messages with source line numbers
- More helpful hints for common mistakes
- Better constraint violation reporting

Estimated Work: 3-4 hours

5. Optimization Passes

CGen Has:
- Dead code elimination
- Constant folding
- Loop optimization hints

Estimated Work: 8-10 hours (lower priority)

Recommendation

Given the current state:

1. Immediate (current session continuation):
  - Fix function parameter type inference for nested containers (30 min - 1 hour)
  - Test matmul benchmark to completion
2. High Priority (next session):
  - Complete nested container support for all types
  - Fix remaining benchmark failures (dict_ops, set_ops need comprehensions)
3. Medium Priority:
  - Enhanced error messages
  - Memory safety improvements
4. Low Priority:
  - Optimization passes (work but don't add core functionality)

Key Insight: According to CLAUDE.md, "CGen feature parity" was marked complete at v0.1.31,
meaning the core functional features are all integrated. What remains are mainly refinements
and edge cases rather than major missing features.

The current focus should be on fixing the 7 benchmarks (currently 3/7 passing) rather than
porting more from CGen, as this will reveal what's actually needed in practice.
