## Immediate Priorities (Next 2-4 Weeks)

### 1. Documentation Completion (HIGH)
**Status**: 60% complete

**Needed**:
- [ ] Backend selection guide (when to use which backend)
- [ ] Use cases documentation (real-world integration patterns)
- [ ] Contributing guide (how to add backends, testing, architecture)
- [ ] API reference (auto-generated from docstrings)

**Completed**:
- [x] Getting started tutorial (800 lines, all backends)
- [x] Error handling documentation
- [x] Security policy
- [x] Backend preferences guide

### 2. CLI Improvements (MEDIUM)
**Goals**:
- Progress bars for compilation
- Verbose mode with detailed logging
- Dry-run mode (show what would be generated)
- Better help messages with examples

**Effort**: 2-3 days

### 3. Build System Generation (MEDIUM)
- [ ] Generate `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.
- [ ] Generate Project with build system


### 4. Formal Verification Enhancement (MEDIUM)
**Current**: Array bounds only
**Future**:
- Null pointer safety
- Use-after-free detection
- Integer overflow detection
- Performance: caching, parallel verification

**Effort**: Ongoing as backend features expand

---

## Medium-Term Goals (1-3 Months)

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Debugging support (source maps, debug symbols)
- [ ] IDE integration (VSCode extension at minimum)
- [ ] Performance profiling tools
- [ ] Optimization guide documentation

### Community Building
- [ ] GitHub stars: >100
- [ ] Contributors: >5
- [ ] Production users: >3 organizations
- [ ] Example projects showcase

---

## v1.0 Release Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [x] 5+ backends production-ready (5/6 done)
- [x] Comprehensive test suite (961 tests)
- [x] Error messages with source locations

- [x] Type safety (strict mypy)
- [ ] Backend selection guide
- [ ] CLI improvements (progress, verbose)
- [ ] Use cases documentation
- [ ] Contributing guide
- [ ] API reference

**Progress**: 6/11 complete (55%)

### Community Requirements
- [ ] 3+ production users

## Strategic Focus

### Current Phase: Documentation & Polish
1. âœ… Backend development (COMPLETE)
2. âœ… Code quality refactoring (COMPLETE)
3. âœ… Formal verification foundation (COMPLETE)
4. ðŸŽ¯ Documentation suite (IN PROGRESS)
5. ðŸŽ¯ CLI/UX polish (NEXT)
6. ðŸ“Š Community building (FUTURE)

### Key Insights
- **Core technical work is solid**: 961 tests, 5 production backends, formal verification
- **Focus needed**: Documentation, CLI polish, community adoption
- **Competitive advantage**: Z3 formal verification (mathematical safety guarantees)
- **Philosophy**: Quality over quantity - polish before expanding

### Next Actions
1. **This week**: Backend selection guide
2. **Next 2 weeks**: CLI improvements, use cases doc
3. **Month 2**: Contributing guide, API reference
4. **Month 3**: v1.0 release, community push

---

## Long-Term Vision

### MGen as Production Tool
- **Niche**: Verified Python-to-Systems-Language translation
- **Differentiator**: Formal verification (Z3) + multiple backends
- **Target users**:
  - Embedded systems developers
  - Safety-critical software teams
  - Performance-sensitive Python projects
  - Polyglot teams (Python prototyping â†’ systems deployment)

### Adoption Strategy
1. **Phase 1** (Current): Complete documentation, polish UX
2. **Phase 2** (Q4 2025): v1.0 release, showcase projects
3. **Phase 3** (Q1 2026): Community building, conference talks
4. **Phase 4** (Q2 2026+): Enterprise adoption, sponsored features
